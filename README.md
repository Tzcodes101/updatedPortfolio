# updatedPortfolio

This website featuers my work so far as a web-developer. It has "About Me," "Contact Me," and "My Portfolio" pages. The contact form is not yet active, as I am still learning back-end material. I do hav additional funcitonality with the nav-bar hamburger menu using Bootstrap 4. As such, the layout functions off of Bootstrap 4 and the grid system. For the future, I intend to make a welcome page and to incorporate much more engaging CSS. However, as I am still learning, I do feel the layout and appearance is improving compared to where I started. The portfolio features my first group project and two homework assignments I feel went well. The code for these items can be accessed as pinned repositories on my GitHub page. My GitHub, LinkedIn, and resume can be accessed on the "About Me" page.

Frameworks used:
-HTML
-CSS
-Bootstrap 4
