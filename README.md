## Description
This website featuers my work so far as a web-developer. It has "About Me," "Contact Me," and "My Portfolio" pages. The contact form is not yet active, as I am still learning back-end material. I do have additional funcitonality with the nav-bar hamburger menu using Bootstrap 4. As such, the layout functions off of Bootstrap 4 and the grid system. The portfolio features three homework assignments I feel went well. The code for these items can be accessed as pinned repositories on my GitHub page. My GitHub, LinkedIn, and resume can be accessed on the "About Me" page.
